<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
It's a project that uses the Google's Api Routes to calculate the routes and return useful information like distance, duration, latitude and longitude of the start location and the destination. I created three fake drivers 
to simulate prices based in their quality, my backend receives the start location and the final locations, consumes the Api routes and return me a list of the drivers with their prices for
this run, if the user confirms the run the ride is saved in my database.
I used Spring Boot in the backend and, in the frontend and Postgres as database.
